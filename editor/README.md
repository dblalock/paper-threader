# Twitter Threading Editor

This is a simple UI written in HTML and JavaScript for writing threads in YAML format.

## How To Use

The page is static so you can just clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

Alternatively, the page is also deployed on Netlify: [https://twitter-threading-editor.netlify.app/](https://twitter-threading-editor.netlify.app/).
